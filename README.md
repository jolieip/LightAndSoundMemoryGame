2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[I ran into a few obstacles. Firstly, the colored buttons were tiny even though it was supposed to be larger. I backtracked by checking whether I had typed the correct size (200*200px) in the CSS file, and I did, which was why the sizing of the buttons confused me a lot. I later realized I had mistyped the ID name in the CSS file, which was why the buttons did not apply the CSS style.  I had misspelled "gameAreaButtons" with "GameAreaButtons." ]

[While I have some Javascript experience, I am still in the process of learning and becoming better. The many functions needed for user interaction confused me. To familiarize myself,  I looked at the code to understand how the logic worked, how the music played and tried to piece the bigger picture together. After that, I tried typing it myself without referring to the code snippets in the guide after I thoroughly reviewed them. Another issue I ran into was the game logic.  This part was the most challenging because I had to make sure the conditions were right by testing out the game multiple times. Then, I compared the logic I had implemented with the model answer and made revisions to my own code.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 


[I would add glowing images to the buttons when the user presses them for a better overall user experience. These animations will capture the user's attention and increase their attention span on the game.  I would also explore other musical tones for a more pleasant melody. To increase the difficulty level, I would add more buttons and change the button patterns to confuse the player. When a player wins, I would add some sound effects and release confetti from the top of the screen. Instead of an alert to inform a player of their win or loss, I would implement it across the screen in bold letters to emphasize it with animations.]
