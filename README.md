1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. Eloquent Javascript (book)

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[I ran into a few obstacles. Firstly, the colored buttons were tiny even though it was supposed to be larger. I backtracked by checking whether I had typed the correct size (200*200px) in the CSS file, and I did, which was why the sizing of the buttons confused me a lot. I later realized I had mistyped the ID name in the CSS file, which was why the buttons did not apply the CSS style.  I had misspelled "gameAreaButtons" with "GameAreaButtons." ]

[While I have some Javascript experience, I am still in the process of learning and becoming better. The many functions needed for user interaction confused me. To familiarize myself,  I looked at the code to understand how the logic worked, how the music played and tried to piece the bigger picture together. After that, I tried typing it myself without referring to the code snippets in the guide after I thoroughly reviewed them. Another issue I ran into was the game logic.  This part was the most challenging because I had to make sure the conditions were right by testing out the game multiple times. Then, I compared the logic I had implemented with the model answer and made revisions to my own code.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[After completing my submission, I would like to learn more about how databases can interact with the website for an interactive experience. What type of databases should we choose for our website? How do we make calls to the database? How should we design the database to make it scalable?  I also have questions about frameworks. How do we integrate AWS into a website? How is the service used? For the front end, how do React.js and Express.js make things easier to code? I'd also like to learn more about data structures and algorithms in Javascript, alongside Javascript built-in methods. These are some of the questions I had after completing my submission. ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 


[I would add glowing images to the buttons when the user presses them for a better overall user experience. These animations will capture the user's attention and increase their attention span on the game.  I would also explore other musical tones for a more pleasant melody. To increase the difficulty level, I would add more buttons and change the button patterns to confuse the player. When a player wins, I would add some sound effects and release confetti from the top of the screen. Instead of an alert to inform a player of their win or loss, I would implement it across the screen in bold letters to emphasize it with animations.]
